# Plant_Microbiome_Phototrophy
This repository contains scripts for studying the role and genomic differences of phototrophic bacteria within plant microbiomes. It focuses on Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria (AAPB) and rhodopsin-based phototrophs in boreal and arctic regions, investigating phototrophic controls and key genomic differences.
